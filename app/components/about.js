                        I&apos;ve always had a passion for creativityâ€”whether it&apos;s drawing, designing, or building something from the ground up. That creative spark is what drew me to programming. I love how it combines logic with imagination, making every project feel like solving a complex puzzle, which is something I&apos;ve always enjoyed.
                        Back in school, I gravitated toward projects that challenged me to think critically about code logic, and that passion has carried over to everything I do today. Though I&apos;m still new to this field, I find it thrilling how programming constantly evolves, presenting new opportunities to learn and grow with each project.
                        When I&apos;m not coding or designing, I love spending time outdoors, especially hiking during the summer. It&apos;s a great way to recharge and find inspiration for the next big challenge.
                        I&apos;m eager to keep exploring, learning, and creating, and I can&apos;t wait to see where this journey takes me!
